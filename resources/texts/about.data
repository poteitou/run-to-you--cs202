Hi. I'm Trinh Nguyen Thao Vi, a 2nd-year CS
student at vnu-hcmus. This game is my solo
project for the Programming Systems course.

The main character is a girl who is running
to her crush. Your mission is to help her so
that she can meet him.

You have to jump over obstacles in order not
to lose lives. Initially, you have a life. Losing
all lives makes the game over. But don't worry!
You can collect hearts on the way to get more
lives. There are 3 levels in this game. The last
one is an endless level so that you can play ...
FOREVERRRR!

Hope you like it!
